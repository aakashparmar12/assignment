    "Q1. Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans .In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming that uses objects and classes in programming.The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. \n",
    "Class:- \"The class can be defined as a collection of objects. It is a logical entity that has some specific attributes and methods. For example: if you have an employee class, then it should contain an attribute and method, i.e. an email id, name, age, salary, etc.\n",
    "The object is an entity that has state and behavior. It may be any real-world object like the mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc.\n",
    "Everything in Python is an object, and almost everything has attributes and methods.\n",
    "When we define a class, it needs to create an object to allocate the memory. Consider the following example"
